## 💡 Pro Tips

### Before You Start
1. **Read STATUS.md first** - Know what exists
2. **Pick your path** - Quick start vs. deep dive
3. **Set expectations** - Phase 1 takes 3-5 days
4. **Get API key** - From https://ai.google.dev/
5. **Check GPU** - Recommended but not required

### While Working
1. **Use debug mode** - Learn from verbose output
2. **Read logs** - Check `logs/` directory
3. **Commit often** - Save your progress
4. **Take notes** - Document your understanding
5. **Ask for help** - Tag `@claude` in issues

### Common Mistakes
❌ Skipping Phase 1 and jumping to Phase 2
❌ Not reading the code
❌ Ignoring tests
❌ Not documenting changes
❌ Working on main branch directly

✅ Complete Phase 1 thoroughly
✅ Read and understand code
✅ Write tests as you go
✅ Document everything
✅ Use feature branches
